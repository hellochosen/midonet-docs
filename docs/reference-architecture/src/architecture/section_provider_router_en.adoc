= Provider router

Provider router is an internal router in MidoNet that acts as the gateway router
of the cloud.

It is created when an external network is created in Neutron. There is always
only one Provider router in the system, even if there are multiple external
networks.

A provider router gets created automatically when you create an external network
in OpenStack.

Note that even though the provider router is a single virtual entity, its state
is distributed in MidoNet, and it doesnâ€™t present a single point of failure as
long as you have multiple Gateway Nodes providing connectivity to the external
network.

In a real deployment, most of the ports connected to the MidoNet Provider Router
are up-link ports, and typically there are multiple unlink ports. (In the
example network described above, the network is not connected to up-link ports.)
Like other virtual ports with connections outside of MidoNet, each port is bound
to a device (Ethernet interface) and a host. The host is a Gateway Node that is
physically connected to the upstream router that goes out to a service provider.

For more information on creating external networks, refer to OpenStack Documentation Install Guides,
latest version is Kilo.
